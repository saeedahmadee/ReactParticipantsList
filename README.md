# ReactParticipantsList

React Participants List is a signup form and a list of participants.
52 items are generated on the server. Table of participants is sortable and there are options for editing and removing a row.
React List is built using SCSS, create-react-app, Semantic UI, Webpack, and Express JS.
Semantic UI is used for user interface library and there is a small server application written with ExpressJS that serves multiple APIs for create, read and delete functions.
(TODO: add edit function)
